But a teardown published Monday from the&nbsp;folks at iFixit found the device a chore to take apart&nbsp;to access its array of internal parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the event of a serious hardware problem, most laptop owners would never tear apart their device, instead relying on the vendor or a repair shop to do the hard labor. But the repairability of a tech product is important in that it tells us how well the manufacturer put all the internal parts together and how expensive the device may be to fix when it&#39;s no longer under warranty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How did the Surface Book score on iFixit&#39;s repairability scale? It received a grade of 1 out of 10 (1 being the worst).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep in mind this is a slim laptop that can convert into a tablet via a detachable keyboard, so Microsoft had to squeeze a lot into a small package. The iFixit team found a variety of components glued or soldered on, making them difficult to remove. The processor and memory are both soldered to the motherboard. A strong adhesive is affixed to many components, including the display, base cover and both batteries. The base battery is &quot;very heavily glued,&quot; according to iFixit, so removing and replacing it would not be an easy task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another &quot;gotcha&quot; is that many of the internal parts are located on the backs of their circuit boards, which means you have to remove the entire motherboard to replace them. Finally, the motherboard itself is inserted upside down and &quot;sprawls throughout the entire chassis, resembling some kind of nightmarish Tetris piece,&quot; iFixit said.

(Sample from one Rahat Maini, whose Twitter page sports a Windows logo: &quot;Android 6.0? More like iOS features from 6 years ago.&quot;) Others suggested he focus on ensuring that Android, Google&#39;s mobile software, wasn&#39;t quite so fragmented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some even wondered whether he&#39;d noticed that Google&#39;s separate Chrome OS looks and works like Windows XP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such was the lively debate on Twitter that Duarte felt the need to explain himself further. He said: &quot;I have no beef with how #Windows10 *looks*. I&#39;m disappointed it *works* just like XP. I understand that&#39;s a feature for many. Not for me!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Microsoft declined to comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, had Microsoft pleased Duarte taste buds, I&#39;m confident that he would have immediately emitted many tweets praising Redmond&#39;s creativity and berating himself for not being as creative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, he did offer a form of praise for Microsoft that some may see as being faint to invisible: &quot;Man, I struck a nerve! Overly clever tweetbait aside, I&#39;ve always liked [what] Microsoft was attempting to do with Windows 8 -- change the paradigm.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem with the paradigm is that it appears to be narrowing all the time. The real estate on phones is becoming samey. Designers seem to find it hard to break through their chosen (design) language barriers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if you were to look at the work of Microsoft and Google, you might decide that the former has attempted more radical design than the latter, both in hardware and software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Microsoft may not have always been successful, but the intent was clearly there.</p>\r\n', '1496131647_5280-2015-11-05.jpg', '', 'cda11up', 'Post', ''),

Roskomnadzor, the Russian media regulator, claimed in court that Telegram was not in compliance with its legal obligations and characterized the messaging service as an &quot;organizer of information distribution,&quot; according to&nbsp;Reuters. Pavel Chikov, Telegram&#39;s lawyer, has already responded to the suit, saying that it is &quot;groundless,&quot; the&nbsp;BBC&nbsp;reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conflict between Telegram and the Russian government goes back to last year, when the FSB (the successor to the KGB) demanded that the founder, Pavel Durov,&nbsp;hand over encryption keys to the service. The reasoning was that terrorists had used the apps to plan an attack, and the FSB needed access to it in the name of national security. Durov has&nbsp;steadfastly refused, even as the Russian government has been threatening to ban Telegram&nbsp;if he didn&#39;t cooperate. Now, it seems, the government is&nbsp;ready to make good on that threat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia has been trying to exert more control over social media and online communications over the years, and legislation passed in 2016 gave them the means to do it. This law requires any messaging service that operates within Russia to provide the government with the ability to decrypt messages, the equivalent of backdoor access. Durov, Telegram&#39;s founder, has long claimed that this is not only unconstitutional, but it&#39;s not feasible from a technical standpoint because of the end-to-end encryption Telegram uses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Russia moves ahead with the ban, then domestic ISPs will have to blacklist domains and IP addresses that Telegram uses. It will be interesting to see what happens, as Facebook recently rejected a demand that it store Russian user data domestically.

We&rsquo;ve not seen a smaller sibling Sammy smartphone since. This could be because people did want smaller, but without the cut in specs that most mini handsets meant. The Galaxy S9 Mini could buck that trend with some impressive specs. And with Apple rumoured to unleash an&nbsp;iPhone SE 2&nbsp;soon, this answer from Samsung makes sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a&nbsp;Geekbench listing&nbsp;we can expect the Samsung Galaxy S9 mini to pack in a decent 4GB of RAM, plenty for nearly every need then. This will be running an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 CPU meaning an Adreno 512 GPU. So all very speedy, then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Few other specs were revealed which does leave the question, is this a mini or just another Samsung smartphone? We&rsquo;ll have to wait and see exactly what the commercial name for this SM-G8750 turns out to be. Since the S9 is an SM-G960, this new handset isn&rsquo;t far removed from that naming class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other specs are not clear but we&rsquo;re hoping for a 5-inch Infinity Display and a decent front and rear camera combo, at least. But, of course, the real appeal will be a more affordable price tag.

Wolastoqiyuk Lintuwakonaw, out Friday (April 6), is an 11-song fusion of his ancestors&#39; archival recordings and his own classical and pop influences, intended to disrupt the &ldquo;bilingual Anglo-centric Canadian music narrative,&rdquo; he tells Billboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 27-year-old -- who is a member of the Tobique First Nations in northwestern New Brunswick, and studied music in Halifax, Nova Scotia -- doesn&#39;t believe this music should be &ldquo;collecting dust on a museum shelf,&rdquo; so he took five years to painstakingly put this album together, transcribing Wolastoq songs more than a century-old &mdash; once banned from being performed in public due to the Canadian government&#39;s discriminatory Indian Act from 1876 &mdash; to re-introduce them to the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dutcher sat down with Billboard over sweetgrass tea at Toronto&#39;s NishDish, a traditional Anishinaabe restaurant, to chat about the album, give us a history lesson &mdash; and teach us some Wolastoq language basics. Be sure to try them on him if you see his show in New York at Joe&#39;s Pub, May 4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To start with, there&#39;s about 60 different Aboriginal languages Canada and Cree is the biggest with 83,000 speakers, according to Statistic Canada, 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cree is the biggest linguistic group, for sure, followed by Anishinaabemowin, which is the Ojibway [19,000], or what&#39;s spoken around here, and then Inuktitut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do they have commonalities?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh yeah. It&#39;s like the language groups in Europe. Think about the romantic languages like French and Italian, they&#39;re so close together because geographically they came out of the same area.

The language, is Wolastoqey wool-las-two-gway. The name of the river is Wolastoq and the name of my people, &ldquo;The People of the River,&rdquo; is Wolastoqiyik, [pronounced] Willisto-wee-ek, and that&#39;s the first word of the record title.

We have like 20 different words to describe that tree &mdash; in the bark, in certain times of season. So much to say that there&#39;s an intimate relationship between language and land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, as a young person with access to that language, a lot of young people don&#39;t speak my language in our community, I was very fortunate in that my mother was able to pass on some, and through this record I&#39;ve been able to double down on my efforts in revitalizing our language and I&#39;ve been working with our stories, and telling our stories in the language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your family and the elders must be thrilled.</p>\r\n', '1523091463_JeremyDutcher.jpg', '', 'cda11up', 'Post', ''),

Or how Facebook, which is the second-largest online ad company in the world, allowed advertisers&nbsp;to market explicitly to people&rsquo;s bigotries, as their software suggested ad-targeting terms like &ldquo;Jew haters&rdquo; and &ldquo;threesome rape.&rdquo; And then there&rsquo;s the reason Zuckerberg finally relented to calls that he testify, the scandal involving political-data firm Cambridge Analytica, wherein the Facebook data of tens of millions people was harvested&nbsp;off the platform&nbsp;and allegedly used to help Trump&rsquo;s campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of this happened on Zuckerberg&rsquo;s watch&mdash;with virtually no federal laws that would have protected Americans&rsquo; privacy and the health of the country&rsquo;s information ecosystem. Depending on what happens at Tuesday&rsquo;s and Wednesday&rsquo;s hearings, Facebook might not stay unregulated for very long. The only major legislative proposal currently drafted and seeking support is the Honest Ads Act, championed by Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner and Republican Sen. John McCain. That bill would require political advertisements on Facebook to list who paid for them, just like political ads on radio, print, and television do, and would levy fines on social media companies that don&rsquo;t follow the rules. On Friday, Facebook executives&nbsp;said in a blog postthat the company does support&nbsp;the Honest Ads Act, although Zuckerberg&nbsp;told Wired&nbsp;last month that he doesn&rsquo;t expect that bill to pass. Considering the public blowback his company is currently facing, that legislation might be the easiest thing for Congress to pull off the shelf to show Americans that Facebook won&rsquo;t pass through this controversy without consequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In broad strokes, most of the concerns members of Congress will likely raise will center on questions of user privacy, election integrity, and the company&rsquo;s indisputable impact on how Americans communicate and get their news. (Some Republicans will probably also raise questions of whether Facebook is in some way biased against conservatives.) Throughout both hearings, lawmakers will likely highlight reporting on how Facebook&rsquo;s internal culture and policies reveal that the company was well aware of how its platform was being misused and yet decided not to take the substantial steps to fix it, all the while continuing to be one of the most valuable companies in the world with control over how billions of people get information and stay connected to their personal and professional communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the committee members really want to move the ball forward in terms of what we know about Facebook, here are some questions they might consider asking Zuckerberg while he&rsquo;s under oath.</p>\r\n', '1523102193_zuck.jpg', '', 'cda11up', 'Post', ''),

Luckily our captain, a Bajo &ldquo;sea gypsy&rdquo; from the fishing people who first settled Borneo&rsquo;s Derawan archipelago, is a master of the marine handbrake turn. He grins and guns the engine; the white sands, tall palms and stilt houses of Derawan island come into focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My teenage son and I have travelled through the coal mine-scarred landscape beyond Berau, a riverside town in Kalimantan on mainland Indonesian Borneo (and reached via two flights from Singapore), to take a boat out to spend a week exploring a few of the archipelago&rsquo;s scores of islands. Only two are officially inhabited, though 30-odd others have names and some are home to scientists and sea-dwelling boat people. By the end of this year the islands will be better connected to the mainland, with the completion of a small airport on Maratua island, which will handle short-haul flights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll be spending the next couple of days at Derawan Dive Lodge, a cluster of elegant wooden cabanas reached by jetty over limpid waters, where green turtles graze on sea grass and algae. At least 15,000 female turtles return to the archipelago every year, often swimming many thousands of kilometres to lay their eggs on the beaches where they had hatched. Now, so many turtles graze off Derawan island, many of them non-local breeders, that their food sources are becoming scarce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The highest tides, around the full moon and the new moon, are the best time to watch the females drag their heavy bodies up the sand and wheeze and grunt through the ovulation process. &ldquo;One laid her eggs under the restaurant a couple of weeks ago,&rdquo; says the lodge&rsquo;s Indonesian manager. We&rsquo;ve missed their hatching, sadly.</p>\r\n', '1523102519_4922.jpg', '', 'cda11up', 'Post', '');
